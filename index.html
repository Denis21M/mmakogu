          <h3>üöÄ Career Transitioning/Development - Fueled by Passion for Technology</h3>
          <p> 
            With a strong background in customer support and problem-solving, I discovered a growing passion for IT, cloud technologies, and automation. That enthusiasm led me to pursue an intensive training program in DevOps and Cloud Engineering, where I immersed myself in building, deploying, and managing modern, scalable applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this transition, I have embraced the mindset of continuous improvement, learning best practices in CI/CD, containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and cloud infrastructure (AWS & Azure). I also mastered tools like Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, and monitoring/logging stacks such as Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and ELK.

            This journey wasn‚Äôt just about learning tools, it was about transforming how I think, work, and solve problems. I built numerous small-scale projects and proudly delivered three major microservices-based applications, showcasing my ability to manage end-to-end cloud-native deployments.
          </p>
          <p></p>
            I‚Äôm confident, capable, and ready to contribute as a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, combining my customer-focused mindset with technical expertise to build solutions that are efficient, secure, and built for scale.

          <h3>üéì DevOps and Cloud Computing - Ironhack</h3>
          <p>
            During this comprehensive and hands-on training program, I gained deep expertise in core DevOps and Cloud Engineering practices. I mastered the tools, technologies, and methodologies required to build, deploy, automate, and monitor scalable applications in real-world environments. The training covered the entire software delivery lifecycle, from Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD pipelines to container orchestration and cloud architecture across both AWS and Azure platforms.
          </p>
            I developed strong competencies in üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and Ansible, and gained hands-on experience with üê≥ containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes (EKS & AKS). I automated build and deployment workflows through üîÅ GitHub Actions and SonarQube, and implemented effective üìä monitoring and logging stacks including Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and the ELK Stack. My scripting and automation skills span across Bash, YAML, and HCL, with practical application in deploying modern üåê web apps using Ingress Controllers, Load Balancers, and TLS/SSL configuration.
          <p>
            On the ‚òÅÔ∏è cloud side, I worked extensively with AWS services such as IAM, EC2, RDS, S3, VPC, and CloudFormation, as well as Azure services such as AKS, RBAC, T-SQL, Entra, and Governance controls. These tools enabled me to architect, deploy, and manage cloud-native solutions with confidence.
          </p>
            Throughout the program, I completed numerous small-scale projects to sharpen my skills and reinforce best practices. Additionally, I‚Äôve delivered three major microservices-based applications, featured in my portfolio, that demonstrate my ability to provision infrastructure, deploy containerized apps, implement monitoring solutions, and secure and scale cloud systems.
          <p>
        üöÄ I am confident, capable, and fully equipped with the hands-on experience and technical knowledge needed to thrive as a DevOps or Cloud Engineer in today‚Äôs fast-paced tech industry. Let‚Äôs build something amazing!

          <p>
            As part of my journey into tech, I completed an in-depth training program in Front-End Development with Mimo, where I developed a strong foundation in building dynamic and responsive web interfaces. The program covered essential technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, alongside tools and platforms like Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code. I also gained hands-on experience with React at an intermediate level, enabling me to build reusable components, manage state, and deliver interactive user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the course, I applied industry best practices in responsive design, version control, and web standards. I built couple of web solutions that demonstrate my ability to translate ideas into real, functional applications which includes this portfolio website you have visited. These projects not only reflect my growing skillset but also my attention to detail and enthusiasm for crafting clean, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>VPC with:</p>
          <p>- 2 Public Subnets (across 2 AZs for redundancy): ALB (Application Load Balancer) for routing external requests and Bastion Host in one AZ for internal access</p>

        <li>

        <li>
          <p>Application Flow:</p>
          <p>- User casts a vote via Vote frontend ‚Üí Redis cache vote ‚Üí worker read votes from redis and writes to Postgres ‚Üí result reads results from Postgres </p>
          <p>- vote port (80:80), result port (81:80), redis port (6379:6379), worker port(no port exposed and no service created because it gets no connection from anywhere), postgres port(5432:5432)</p>
